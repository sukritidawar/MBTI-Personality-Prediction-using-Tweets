We cannot be ""sleepy Christians"" without spiritual fervor, withour intensity in prayer, without passion for the Gospel.|||Our life becomes beautiful when we wait for a dear one or someone important. May this #Advent help us transform our hope into the certainty that He whom we await loves us and will never abandon us.|||Let us be fearless amid the messy situations all around us, because that is where the Lord is, in our midst; God continues to perform his miracle of bringing forth good fruit (Jn 15:5). Christian joy is born precisely of this certainty.|||The prayer of adoration is the prayer that makes us recognize God as the beginning and the end of all of History. And this prayer is the living flame of the Spirit that gives strength to witness and to mission.|||Let us not to forget to thank God.

I also invite you to repeat the strong moment of witness and prayer that we lived last Friday in Assisi. is the word that makes hope blossom in the world and relieves the suffering of the poor: tenderness. We need to overcome the temptation to be concerned only about our own problems; we need to grow tender before the tragedies of our world, to share its pain.|||Let us bring an outlook of hope to our world.

Saint Paul tells us: “Love never ends” (1 Cor 13:8).|||We are called to discover Christ in the poor, to lend our voice to their causes, but also to be their friends, to listen to them, to understand them and to welcome the mysterious wisdom that God wants to communicate to us through them. is time that the circle of indifference be broken so as to discover once again the beauty of encounter and dialogue.|||It is time that violence against women cease and that they be respected and not treated like bargaining chips.|||It is time to be scandalised once again before the reality of children who are starving, reduced to slavery, tossed about in the water in the aftermath of a shipwreck, innocent victims of every sort of violence.|||It is time for sleeves to be rolled up so dignity can be restored by creating jobs.|||It is time that eyes be opened to see the state of inequality in which many families live.|||It is time that the poor be given back their voice, because for too long their requests have remained unheard.|||Here at the Portiuncula, Saint Francis welcomed Saint Clare, the first brothers, and many poor people who came to him.

The threat of antisemitism still lurking in Europe and elsewhere is a threat that must be defused.|||The world needs Christians who know how to demonstrate the beauty of the Gospel by the way they live; who are weavers of dialogue, models of fraternal life; who bring the sweet fragrance of hospitality and solidarity, who protect and safeguard life.|||Let us #PrayTogether for the people of #Ethiopia, so sorely tried by the conflict that has lasted more than a year and has caused numerous victims and a serious humanitarian crisis. I renew my appeal for fraternal harmony on the peaceful path of dialogue.|||In the #GospelOfTheDay (Mk 12:38-44), Jesus proposes the poor wideo as a teacher of faith: the sound of her few coins is more beautiful than the grandiose offerings of the rich, since they express a life sincerely dedicated to God with unconditional trust.|||Let us care for our common home, and also for ourselves, trying to eliminate the seeds of conflict: greed, indifference, ignorance, fear, injustice, insecurity and violence. Humanity has never before had at its disposal so many means for achieving this goal #COP26 #EnvConflictDay|||Consolation is a strength that does not come from ourselves, but from the One who is with us: Jesus, the God-with-us.

The Heart of Christ is an impassioned heart, wounded by love, torn open for us on the cross. That tenderness and suffering, that Heart reveals what God's passion is: man.|||Memory. To remember means ""to return with the heart"". It is good for us to nurture our memory with those who have loved us, taken care of us, lifted us up. The Heard of Jesus reminds us that whatever happens to us in life, we are loved.|||Contemplating the Heart of Christ, we can allow ourselves to be guided by three words: memory, passion and comfort.|||Being a member of the people of God is a gift, a responsibility: the responsibility of witnessing by our deeds, not just our words, to God’s wonderful works, which, once known, help people to acknowledge his existence and to receive his salvation. #Synod|||May the protection of minors be more and more a concrete, ordinary priority within the Church's educational works. May it be the promotion of an open, trustworthy and reliable service, in strict contrast to every form of domination, betrayal of intimacy or silent complicity.|||Today, before the mystery of death that has been redeemed, let us ask for the grace of perceiving adversity with new eyes. Let us ask for the strength to know how to live in humble and confident silence that awaits the Lord's salvation, without complaining and without grumbling.",
INTP,"I usually read a lot of non-fiction books, but lately I’ve found myself drawn back to the kinds of novels I would’ve loved as a kid. These were some of my favorites this year: do you like better?|||There’s lots of speculation about what Shakespeare’s life was really like, but we do know that his son died at age 11. Hamnet shares the story of how grief tore the Shakespeare family apart. I was a kid, I was obsessed with science fiction. But @andyweirauthor’s latest book Project Hail Mary is a fun read even if you aren’t a sci-fi fan. I finished the whole thing in one weekend. read a lot of great books this year. These were some of my favorites. really enjoyed reading these five books this year, and I think you will too: hard to believe that it’s been 50 years since the 4004 kickstarted the PC era.

This #WorldToiletDay, I’m optimistic this sanitation crisis can be solved. saw incredible innovation in health and climate. I am excited about many of these advancements and look forward to seeing what’s next. love the message in @JohnDoerr’s new book that in order to eliminate the Green Premiums, we need to make a scalable plan now: bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is an important step on America’s path to achieving net-zero emissions. But the job is not done. Congress should also pass the Build Back Better Act to help accelerate development of the climate solutions we need. sharing and global collaboration move us closer to new #Alzheimers diagnostics, treatments, and cures. I’m optimistic about what lies ahead: still have a lot of work to do, but the conversation I heard at the #COP26 climate summit left me feeling optimistic that we can avoid a climate disaster: on student outcomes can help institutional leaders and policymakers better understand the economic value that colleges deliver to students. This new tool makes that data publicly available—a critical step toward a more equitable higher ed system. and the world’s top global health problems are closely connected.

By working to minimize its effects, we are also working to improve global health. However, ending malaria needs to (and should) happen faster: can be an expert in all things at once. To end malaria—or any disease—leaders from around the world need to collaborate to make sustainable progress: recently had the chance to meet 36 incredible graduate students working to #endmalaria.
